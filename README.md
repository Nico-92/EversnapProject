Clone the repo from https://github.com/Nico-92/EversnapProject.git

From the root directory, install the dependencies with sudo npm install and then bower install

Start the server with the command grunt serve

After the server is ok you have to change the url from 127.0.0.1:9000 to localhost:9000/#/ otherwise facebook doesn’t recognize the application and you can’t log.
